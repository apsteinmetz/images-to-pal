# images-to-pal
Tile multiple images then make a palette using their principal colors using k-means

This just copies http://www.milanor.net/blog/build-color-palette-from-image-with-paletter/ with the added twist of tiling multiple images before creating the palette.  I wanted to see if some cartoon show palettes using this method matched those in the ggsci package.  The ggsci palettes don't seem particularly attractive.  Did the authors use the algorithmic approach I will use here?  Will my approach look any better?  Don't know.

For the record, the one pop culture derived palette I really like is the Wes Anderson palette available here: https://github.com/karthik/wesanderson and on CRAN.  These are presumably lovingly curated and created, not like the ones created by the stupid robots I use here.
